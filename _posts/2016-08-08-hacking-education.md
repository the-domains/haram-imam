# Hacking Education

I went to a hacker conference in Las Vegas this week. Hacking culture has been around long enough that there are now second generation hackers, children of hackers that are coming to hacker conferences and participating in workshops specifically targeting children. I think this is good for those children and society in general. Here's why.

## It's all about Science

I contend that Computer Science, and specifically the kind represented by the hacking culture is among the best ways to learn the scientific method. Now, "science" means a lot of different things to different people, so I want to distinguish two common uses:

Science1 - v. "A methodology for separating delusion from world-views thru doubt and experimentation."

Science2 - n. "A body of knowledge or world-view ostensibly derived using Science1."

This distinction between two sciences is essentially the distinction between code and data, a distinction frequently exploited by hackers. I contend that one of the deep ways the US's educational system is broken is that it focuses on Science2 at the expense of Science1\. Smearing out many, many details to get the big picture, "Science" as a school topic is usually presented as a network of facts to be memorized and repeated back on the test. This is Science2, a historical record of the excretions of Science1\. When the methodology is taught, as in Chemistry labs or Physics labs, the experiment is typically prescribed by the teacher, with a correct answer already specified.

While this laboratory work has the value of giving students hands on experience with how to use lab equipment and replicating past experiments, it is definitely Science2, not Science1\. Science1 does not already know the answer. If you have preferences, judgements, expectations about how the experiment should turn out, this inevitably corrupts the scientific process. Desire creates confirmation bias, cherry picking of data. If anything but Truth is the object of desire, the mind will warp the data to match the desired outcome. \[Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves\] (http://deoxy.org/wiki/The\_Thinker\_and\_the\_Prover) This is precisely the phenomenon that the scientific method, Science1, was designed to counteract.

## Eat data, excrete delusion.

A good example of this phenomenon is how drug research is funded by government agencies. Inevitably, future funding from these agencies is implicitly dependent upon the researchers coming out with the "correct" answers, namely, that (some) drugs are bad and therefore we should continue spending billions of taxpayer dollars putting people in cages for using them. See \[here\](https://erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma\_neurotoxicity3.shtml)

And this connects to why, if you are a king/leader/ruling-class that would like to maintain dominion over your underlings/vassals/serfs, you might prefer the students in your kingdom to learn Science2 and not Science1\. Dominion is a two-player game, it requires the implicit consent of both parties, the dominated and the dominator, to believe in and act their corresponding roles. The servant should be skillful in the role and should not improvise on it. The evolution of new techniques to achieve a goal, or the evolution of new goals following introspection are not for the commoner, according to the dominator paradigm.

This in turn connects to the phenomenon of conservative versus liberal, past and future, inertia and energy. In a very broad sense, there are social elements who want things to remain the same, presumably because they are winning, doing well, or at least comfortable, and there are elements that want things to change because they are presumably unhappy with how things currently are. Kings generally spend a lot of energy becoming King. They generally would like things to stay the same in that regard, to get a good return on their investment. This represents the force of memory, of inertia, of heavy matter, fixed perceptions, rigid models, crystalline knowledge, dogma, stability, decay, entropy, \[tamas\](http://www.yogabasics.com/learn/the-3-gunas-of-nature/).

## Science1 implies Change

As a contrast, Science1 starts from the assumption that we have a world-view and it is probably incorrect in some way. Science1 is essentially in a feedback loop with Reality. Science1 does not tell Reality how She should be, it seeks to discover Her, to dance with Her, to reflect off of Her. This connects to the hacker ethos, as expressed by Dan Kaminsky: \["The primary thing that we break, as hackers, are assumptions. People think they know how the world works, and there's how they really work, and there's a difference."\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wx2TnaRSGs). The space between what the manufacturer of a machine intended it to be used and how the machine really works is the gap between language and reality. Exploits come from that space, as do many other creative behaviors.

If we blur our eyes, zoom out a little, we can see that this process of getting a world-view closer to Reality is actually isomorphic to the processes of Learning and Evolution. Minds evolve new hypotheses, new world-views, and some of them survive longer than others when thrown against the selective pressures of experiment. Those that have so far survived the longest are called "knowledge" and made into an effigy of Truth, the current leaders in the memetic race to live long and prosper. This is one of the primary revelations of Machine Learning, that measuring how incorrect a hypothesis can tell us how to improve the hypothesis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27\_theorem).

## Frequency Matters

And this leads us back to education. The size of the feedback loop described by Science1 makes a huge difference in the speed of learning, particularly the speed of learning how to learn, learning Science1\. Putting aside the educational methodologies typically employed, doing experiments in a physics or chemistry lab typically involves feedback loops that can last from hours to years. It can take a long time to get the results of such experiments and analyze them to see how wrong the hypothesis was. \["If it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong." \] (https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/06/richard-feynman-the-key-to-science/) Compare this with computer programming, in which one's hypothesis about what a program does can typically be invalidated within minutes. The programming routine typically looks something like this:

1 Start with a goal

2 Write a program that you think achieves that goal

3 Run the program and see if it achieves the goal

4 If it doesn't go back to step 2, otherwise stop

In my experience as an educator, I have found that students who practice this routine for at least a few months typically unlock an incredible nascent ability to learn. So much of programming is trial and error, trying things, failing, trying something else, failing again, asking the internet for help, trying again, trying again. It's messy, organic, alive, \[anti-fragile\](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/). Learning doesn't happen without failure, without a \[loss function\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss\_function), some kind of feedback from Reality.

Any educational system that punishes failure too severely is actually crippling students. It pushes a student's \[significance level\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type\_I\_and\_type\_II\_errors\#Type\_I\_error) so high that it becomes paralyzing.

### "Don't try to innovate, don't take risks, the cost of being wrong is too great!" - Not Hackers

This is why the hacking ethos is so critical to education. On a planet overflowing with humans, if we want to live long and prosper, we should focus our scarce educational resources on the most important skill: how to learn. Hacking is experimentation is learning is evolution is Science1\.
